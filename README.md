SpacEx App:-

1. Technology stack:-
   Library - Server side rendered ReactJS built on top of NodeJS express web framework.
   Testing library - Jest-Enzyme.
   Style - powered by sass/scss.

2. Set Up:-
   Clone the repository and execute following commands:- >yarn install >yarn start
   application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/

3. Technology which could have been used is as follows:-

   > Typescript
   > Redux
   > HTTP client libraries like axios.

   Note:- I did not use these to avoid unnecessary overhead as the application is very small, and to keep the bundle size small.

4. Initial data is server side rendered

5. Api for data doesn't return successful landing data for the key land_success, that is why it has been binded as NA at the UI.

6. Following are the screenshots of Lighthouse score:-
